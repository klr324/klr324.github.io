      <p>Currently, I am a research technologist for the network for Sustainable Climate Risk 
          Management (SCRiM) at Pennsylvania State University. A few of my activities include 
          supporting archival and accessibility of research and climate data, testing and 
          validating research codes and models across multiple personal and universities, 
          and developing visualization, analysis, and educational tools. Additionally, I serve as a member 
          of NOAA’s Mid-Atlantic Regional Integrated Sciences and Assessments team and as a member 
          of the Visualizing Forest Futures team, where we work to help build the resilience of communities to climate change impacts</p>

      <p>Over the past years, I have been lucky enough to publish several peer-reviewed scientific papers. 
          The research page of this website is a great way to check out the research projects I conducted or was apart of.</p>

      <p>I completed a Bachelor of Science in geology from Bowling Green State University and earned a Master's degree in Geoscience from Penn State University. At PSU, I was supervised by Dr. Klaus Keller and coadvised by Dr. Chris Forest. In my thesis, I analyzed the impacts of statistical calibration methods on the upper tails of global sea-level projections. This research was presented at the European Geosciences Union spring 2015 meeting and was published in <a href="http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10584-016-1858-z#Bib1" target="_blank">Climatic Change</a> in 2017.</p>

      <p>I enjoy being out in the field and working with Earth-system models — check out my field work and 
          research pages. My past work with models deal with Bayesian statistics, projecting sea-level 
          rise, estimating storm surge, modeling forest landscapes, and projecting ice melt. I love designing maps and 
          interactive applications, especially when its used to help convey information to the general public. My past 
          research in the field was working on issues related to harmful algal blooms
          in a Chemistry lab under Dr. Bob Midden. For this research, I collected and analyzed water samples for high concentrations 
          of ammonia, E. Coli, phosphate, and nitrate along the Portage river.</p>

      <p>I enjoy traveling, anything volcano related, hiking, bouldering, kayaking, photography, camping, 
          and cross stitching/quilting. Having grown up in the midwest, specifically the snow-belt of Ohio, I enjoy really good blizzards and thunderstorms.</p>
