  <ul>
<li>Currently, I am a scientific programmer for the network for Sustainable Climate Risk 
Management at Pennsylvania State University.</li>
<br>
<li>As of December 2015, I am a gradute of Penn State University with a Masters degree in 
Geoscience. At PSU, I was supervised by Dr. Klaus Keller and coadvised by Dr. Chris Forest. 
My thesis project involved analyzing the impacts of statistical calibration methods on the 
upper tails of global sea-level projections.</li>
<br>
<li>I have a Bachelor of Science in Geology from Bowling Green State University in Ohio 
(received December 2013) and did undergraduate research in a Chemistry lab under Dr. Bob Midden.</li>
<br>
<li>I enjoy being out in the field & working with climate models â€” check out my field work and 
research. My past work with climate models deal with Bayesian statistics, projecting sea-level 
rise, and projecting ice sheet melt. I have also recently become an avid and active Shiny and ArcGIS user.</li>
<br>
<li>The research page is a nice place to see some of my work and codes.</li>
<br>
<li>I enjoy traveling, anything volcano related, hiking, kayaking, photography, camping, 
and recently cross stitching/quilting.</li>
<br>
<li> Because I grew up in the Midwest and the snowbelt of Ohio, 
I do enjoy a good blizzard and thunderstorm.</li>
