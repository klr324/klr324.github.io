I am a geologist, climate scientist, and scientific programmer. Currently, I'm a scientific programmer with the Sustainable Climate Risk Management Network. I graduated from Bowling Green State University in the winter or 2013 with my bachelors in geology. Following BGSU, I attended Penn State University. Under the supervision of Klaus Keller and Chris Forest, I received my masters in geosciences December 2015. My masters' thesis was on analyzing the impacts of statistical calibration methods on the upper tails of global sea-level projections.

Prior to my research in sea-level rise, I worked in a chemistry lab under the supervision of Dr. Bob Midden.
