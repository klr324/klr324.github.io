  <h2><a href="/fieldwork/geojourney">GeoJourney</a></h2>
  <p><a href="http://www.geojourney.org">GeoJourney</a> was a nine-week field/road trip program sponsered by Bowling Green
  State University. Along the trip, we stopped at many national parks and monuments to earn 18 credits covering geology, 
  environmental studies, and American culture studies.</p>

  <h2><a href="/fieldwork/fieldcamp">Field Camp</a></h2>
  <p>I did my <a href="https://www.bgsu.edu/arts-and-sciences/earth-environment-and-society/geology/field-camp.html">
    field Camp</a> experience with Bowling Green State University. At BG, field camp is a six-week field course in the 
    Basin and Range, Colorado Plateau, and Rocky Mountain provinces. During the course, I learned how to measure and analyze 
    sedimentary sections, construct geologic maps, analyze structural folds and faults, and analyze slope stability. 
    Throughout the course we used Brunton compasses, ruggedized tablet PC computers, GPS receivers, aerial photographs, 
    topography maps, satellite images, and GIS databases to conduct the excercises.</p>

  <h2><a href="/fieldwork/portage">Portage River Contamination</a></h2>
  <br>
  <p>During my time at BGSU I also did undergraduate research with the program 
  <a href="https://www.bgsu.edu/setgo/setgo-summer-research-ssr.html">SETGO</a>. I chose to do research on 
  harmful agal blooms in the Chemistry department.</p>
  
  <p>Since the mid 1900s, nutrients from rivers have produced algal blooms in Lake Erie. Large algal blooms can cause 
  harmful affects to organisms, harm aesthetics, as well as many other issues. In this study, we analyzed Portage River 
  water samples for Phosphate, Ammonia, Nitrate, and E. Coli concentrations. Additionally, we analyzed macroinvertebrates 
  to characterize long term effects of high nutrient concentrations.</p>
  
  <p>Due to this research, we identified a stretch of the river blocked by natural log dams. These dams just downstream 
  of a wastewater treatment plant created the perfect environment for large algal mats (3ft+ in height) to grow. 
  This area was identified as a local deadzone with an identified toxic strain of algae and methane production from 
  algal mat decomposition.</p>
  
  <p>The Portage River is a medium sized river flowing into Lake Erie. While small, the Portage River can act as a 
  model for how to analyze larger rivers flowing into Lake Erie. This study was supervised by Dr. Midden at BGSU 
  and is current ongoing research.</p>
